skill this summer within a penn summer module. topics may include: biology of antidepressants, media, activism and social movements , anthropology, college prep, critical approaches to popular culture, film studies, photography, urban justice, climate change, genetics, and computer science. taught by members of penn's department of biology and other regional biology teachers, the goal of this program is to introduce you to the experimental basis of biology, including relevance to disease. the focus of the program will be on how we know what we know. daily morning lectures and discussions on the cellular, molecular and genetic aspects of biology will be followed on some days by guest lectures from scientists and clinicians from penn’s department of biology and from the penn medical school. afternoons will be spent in the laboratory with hands-on experiments that introduce you to the tools and techniques used in biomedical research labs. you will also participate in a small group “journal club” where you will learn to read primary scientific literature on a current topic of interest. prerequisites : one year of high school biology is required for application. one year of high school chemistry is strongly advised. program director : dr. linda robinson, ph.d. dr. robinson is an adjunct assistant professor of biology and an instructional laboratory coordinator at

and prove basic theory through the knowledge and lab skills. each lab group will construct and use its own apparatus to measure the speed of light. the program is organized to allow students to become familiar with laboratory hardware they use and to actually assemble and test some of it. prerequisite: previous physics experience is encouraged, though not required. the mathematics academy is a unique opportunity for students interested in examining mathematical concepts rarely offered at the high school level. this rigorous, proof-oriented program will fuse lectures, problem sessions, demonstrations, and exploratory research to engage students in topics such as: discrete mathematics combinatorics (enumerative, algebraic, geometric) generating functions and partitions graph theory probability combinatorial game theory algebra and number theory linear algebra prime and factorization algorithms congruences and quadratic reciprocity galois theory geometry of numbers geometry and topology euclidean ad non-euclidean geometries geometric transformations algebraic geometry point-set topology knot theory relevant field trips, including the national math museum in new york city, and the national cryptologic museum, may also be included. prerequisite : one year of high school algebra ii/trigonometry is required for application. program director: nakia rimmer this academy is designed to introduce students to the biological foundations of the brain. lectures will introduce students to important neuroscientific topics, progressing from the cellular foundations of the neuron, to an understanding of the sensory systems, and culminating with higher-order cognitive functions such as memory, emotion, and morality. in the afternoons, students will participate in hands-on laboratory activities, where they will learn important experimental techniques. during this time, students will also be able to visit several active research laboratories. additionally, students will engage in a small group “journal club” where they will gain experience reading the neuroscience literature related to a particular topic of choice, and which culminates in a group

6103,"arts & design, leadership, life skills, social sciences, stem"," this workshop will introduce students to young children’s literature and its importance to the development of language and pre-literacy skills. we will explore classic children’s books, the importance to young children of seeing themselves in the books they read, and contemporary examples of children’s books that provide positive images and stories for all children. students will discuss assigned readings in the morning half of the workshop, and analyze selected children’s books. in the afternoon, students will have hands-on relevant experiences to put their morning work to use including visiting a local bookshop, the town library and an early childhood program. students will also present group projects. assigned readings will be required for class discussion. this workshop starts with the premise that food is an essential ingredient in the making of selves, families, communities, regions, and nations. we will explore the ways that we celebrate food traditions, create new habits and tastes, and also respond to food problems (e.g. food scarcity and safety, climate change and land use, and the complex networks of food producers, servers, and consumers). our readings will draw from a variety of different fields and perspectives, including literature, history, anthropology, and environmental studies, as well as various genres of food writing - the personal essay, the recipe, and scholarly essays on the intersections between food and culture. our course materials will provide an introduction into the emergent and growing interdisciplinary field of “food studies” and will help us see food as inextricably connected to our economic, political, and social structures. this intensive weeklong workshop will provide students with an introduction to the fundamentals of photography. technical skills such as camera use, composition, lighting, developing, and printing will be learned through demonstrations and assignments. conceptual, aesthetic, and critical skills essential to understanding photography's broader role in contemporary art and society will be learned through, readings, discussions, lectures, and critiques.  in this workshop, students will explore the hidden depths of what is around us, learning to ask and answer the kinds of questions that inspire scholars. in the first week, our focus will be on names, as we examine the stories behind the labels that we affix to people, places, and things. these explorations will be driven by questions that are at once philosophical and practical: how do new products get their names, and how do those names influence consumers? who decides what new names for things end up in the dictionary? what happens when a country changes its name? in the second week, we’ll shift gears to examine the physical world around us, using wellesley’s campus as our laboratory. the college’s unique landscape and architecture will provide an exciting source of study, as we probe the meaning behind the hogwarts-style buildings and trace the experiences of students who have come before us. throughout the course, we’ll take both an analytical and a creative approach to our topic, and students will have the chance to produce written arguments, imagine and pitch new products, and try their hand at making metaphors, maps, and multi-media scholarly projects. this intensive studio course is designed to help intensify your visual sensitivity, spatial awareness and creative response through the mediums of drawing and printmaking. in the first half of the course, we will focus on observational drawing—you will learn to translate what you see in the three-dimensional space around you to the two-dimensional surface of paper. in the second week, you will apply these observational skills to relief and monotype printmaking processes, and get to see your images reversed, multiplied and in color! by developing a sensitivity for materials, an understanding of key visual elements, and an ability to discuss visual concepts, you will build a strong foundation for yourself in the arts. by expanding the scope of your design ideas, this program will enhance your abstract thinking, problem-solving and visual communication skills while helping you develop necessary tools to exhibit and present your work. as the scenic, lighting, and costume designer, you will learn to read and analyze a script, sketch, draft and build scale models, create a light plot, swatch and render costume designs. taught by experienced faculty and professional designers who share their own processes and provide experience in all aspects of design/technology, this program will expand your portfolio and your understanding of what you will be doing in college and beyond. writing very short fiction and creative non-fiction like travel writing offers students an intensive opportunity to work as real writers work: real writers write, show their work to friendly readers, and revise. this course is for young women who already write fiction and/or creative non-fiction and for those who have never written a story or a travel essay, but are ready to take a chance. in this class, you will be a world builder. how can you create/imagine new possibilities for ourselves and others through your writing? what kinds of futures have you been made aware of through recent science fiction/fantasy films, and how can you use your analyses of the films to affect the way people see the world? by studying recent fantasy films, you will find inspiration for your own constructions of the future. while practicing the basics of expository writing (developing ideas, polishing our prose, making clear arguments, and organizing paragraphs), you will read other writers’ published work about how to make our world better. but it will be your words that push the boundaries of what others believe is possible. join me in suspending disbelief and believing in your power to change the world.
 there’s no better place to discover your voice, your strengths and who you are as a leader than at wellesley. in this workshop, we’ll begin by taking a look at successful women leaders and role models throughout history to better understand leadership and some of the barriers women have faced. then we will explore many different types of leadership behaviors such as relationship building, teamwork, empathy, resilience, self-expression, navigating conflict, communication styles, learning from mistakes and more. during the week, you will participate in a variety of self-assessments, and fun yet thoughtful activities designed to help identify interests and strengths. you will learn a lot about yourself and your impact on those around you. you’ll leave with a visual representation of your pathway and some great insights about yourself as a present and future leader. what does your personal brand, or how you present yourself in the world, say about you? it's time to take a look and discover your voice, your strengths and who you are as a leader. our journey will start by taking a look back at successful women leaders and discussing how their strengths and values helped them be successful. we'll look at leadership in general and some of the barriers women have faced. then we will explore many different types of leadership behaviors such as relationship building, teamwork, empathy, resilience, self-expression, navigating conflict, communication styles, learning from mistakes and more. at the same time, you'll learn critical skills to help you present your unique strengths and show the world who you are. gain social confidence and competence with foundational skills that will not only carry you through life, but also provide you with a competitive advantage as you kick start your grown-up life.this hands-on workshop includes interactive activities and role-playing to help you polish your presence and build basics in financial literacy. topics will cover a broad range of topics, including college & career interviewing skills, email writing, social media netiquette, table manners, budgeting basics, hand-shakes and introductions.you will participate in a variety of self-assessments, and fun yet thoughtful activities designed to help identify interests and strengths. you will learn a lot about yourself and your impact on those around you. this course will help students develop an understanding of women’s leadership and ways of influencing organizations.  topics will examine the personal, social, and structural dynamics that affect women as leaders, particularly in terms of how they are viewed, how their contributions are evaluated, and what kinds of opportunities are available to them. students will begin to uncover and understand the unique challenges, constraints, and opportunities that face women today as they ascend to leadership positions. key themes include the dynamics of power, authority, and influence, being different, managing multiple roles, and social expectations as they pertain to women.
 as college in the us becomes increasingly expensive and competitive, it’s worth asking what role institutions of higher education play in our society. do they promote equity and equality? do they transform or preserve the status quo? do we prioritize their value as a private or as a public good, that is, as something that benefits the individual, or as something that the public invests in for some broader social goal? students will read and write about the work of political theorists and educators in order to consider what the political and social mission of the university should be. we will also investigate the business of higher education, examining what happens when a college’s financial considerations might conflict with its educational mission. other topics we’ll explore include the public financing of college, student debt, practices of for-profit universities, and the size of college endowments.
 we're constantly hearing about feminism these days. some think it's essential for modern life; others see it leading to the downfall of almost everything good. this course offers an introduction to feminism: what is it, what does it want, and how does it go about reaching its goals. we're going to focus on american feminism as it's developed by a variety of women: non-white and white, lgbtq+ and heterosexual, liberal and conservative, to name a few. this workshop will provide an introduction to the topic of abnormal psychology. specifically, we will first discuss how to diagnose mental illness, including ethical considerations, and then we will cover several different categories of mental disorder (e.g., neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and attention deficit disorder, depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia, etc.), with an emphasis on diagnosis and intervention (prevention and treatment). we will review case studies, video clips, and movies to highlight the way that different forms of mental illness are expressed. from the women’s marches to the #metoo movement, we are living in a moment of feminist uprising. yet for many young women, “feminism” is a bad word—a label that connotes man-hating and extremism, or that reflects the narrow experience of privileged white women. this course invites a deeper understanding of what feminism means today, exploring a range of modern feminist narratives with a focus on women of color. our discussion will be guided by several critical questions: how do the many facets of women’s identities—particularly race, gender, class, and sexuality—shape their needs, desires, and priorities? how might these differences be a source of collective power rather than division? in sum, what are the challenges and possibilities of building a truly inclusive feminist movement? students will have the unique opportunity to explore feminist arts and activism on the wellesley college campus, with field trips to the davis museum and college archives. in grappling with the “f-word,” students will hone their skills in analytical writing, while exploring their own relationship with feminism in a capstone personal essay. we all have friends and we tend to regard friendship as an important good. this seminar undertakes a philosophical examination of the nature and value of friendship. two main questions will animate the course: what is a friend? and, why are friends valuable? we will examine different types of friendships and the features that characterize and sustain them. many philosophers have argued that the best kind of friendship is one in which the friend is loved for her own sake; we will investigate whether this is truly possible or whether all friendships are ultimately instrumental. we'll also examine how the partiality inherent in friendship conflicts with the demands of standard moral theories. finally, drawing on examples from literature and film, we will consider whether one has to be a good person in order to be a good friend. in 2007, for the first time in history, more people lived in cities than rural communities. by 2050, the un predicts that over two-thirds of people will live in cities. we face an increasingly urban future, and an uncertain one. this class invites us to pause and reflect on the basics of cities and the urban experience. we will start with the individual experience of city life, then explore neighborhood structure, before scaling up to consider globalization and world cities. throughout we will explore key challenges of urban life: segregation, social inequality, poverty, gentrification, and the changing basis of community and belonging. to understand the city, we will start our discussions in the classroom, bringing in documentaries and short readings, and then embark on two field trips to nearby boston to see concepts in action and to hone our skills as social observers. students will learn to see the city in more detail, and write analytically and persuasively from their own observations. bring your walking shoes and your imagination – this is a course where you will learn on your feet. this workshop is designed to hone students’ spanish speaking skills. students will engage with formal and informal registers through different language samples, including those from social media outlets, academic texts, and different forms of cultural expressions—namely, poetry, fiction, culinary arts, and film. the past decade has seen crowds take to the streets time and again to confront unjust policies and infractions in the rule of law. while such protests have a relatively long history, stretching back at least as far as the 18th century, what has been new is the proliferation of alternative forms of protest, rooted largely in the the visual and performing arts. this course examines ways in which artists have increasingly made their voices heard in the political arena, using image and text to express dissent and move others to action. we examine case studies from around the world, including countries as far-flung as russia, china, mexico, and the u.s. we also consider the ways artists have challenged their publics to think more deeply about some of the fundamental issues related to gender, class, race, and the current world order. the course combines a historical and theoretical perspective with hands-on assignments and activities that ask students to engage themselves in cultural and political critique. no prior experience in art-making necessary. with readings, documentary films, discussions, and lectures, this course will examine the complex spiritual beliefs and expressions of peoples of african descent in brazil, cuba, haiti, jamaica, and north america. the course surveys african diasporic religions such as candomble, santeria, voodoo, shango, and african american religions. attention will be paid to how diasporic africans practice religion for self-definition, community building, and sociocultural critique, and for reshaping the religious and cultural landscapes of the americas. achilles' heel, the trojan horse, pandora's box, an oedipal complex, and a herculean task. these themes and figures from classical mythology continue to play an important role in our everyday life. we will read the original tales of classical heroes and heroines as depicted by homer, the greek tragedians, vergil, ovid, and others. why do these stories continue to engage, entertain, and even shock us? what is the nature and power of myth? readings from ancient sources in english translation. this course offers an introduction to some of the major subfields of psychology, such as developmental, personality, abnormal, clinical, physiological, cognitive, cultural, and social psychology. students will explore various theoretical perspectives and research methods used by psychologists to study the origins and variations in human behavior. thinking sociologically enables us to understand the intersection of our individual lives with larger social issues and to grasp how the social world works. students in this course will become familiar with the background of sociology and the core analytical concepts employed by sociologists. students will also gain familiarity with the major substantive topics explored by sociology, with focused attention given to the study of social structures, material, cultural, and institutional explanations of social action, and using concepts for real-world problem-solving.

and, why are friends valuable? we will examine different types of friendships and the features that characterize and sustain them. many philosophers have argued that the best kind of friendship is one in which the friend is loved for her own sake; we will investigate whether this is truly possible or whether all friendships are ultimately instrumental. we'll also examine how the partiality inherent in friendship conflicts with the demands of standard moral theories. finally, drawing on examples from literature and film, we will consider whether one has to be a good person in order to be a good friend. in 2007, for the first time in history, more people lived in cities than rural communities. by 2050, the un predicts that over two-thirds of people will live in cities. we face an increasingly urban future, and an uncertain one. this class invites us to pause and reflect on the basics of cities and the urban experience. we will start with the individual experience of city life, then explore neighborhood structure, before scaling up to consider globalization and world cities. throughout we will explore key challenges of urban life: segregation, social inequality, poverty, gentrification, and the changing basis of community and belonging. to understand the city, we will start our discussions in the classroom, bringing in documentaries and short readings, and then embark on two field trips to nearby boston to see concepts in action and to hone our skills as social observers. students will learn to see the city in more detail, and write analytically and persuasively from their own observations. bring your walking shoes and your imagination – this is a course where you will learn on your feet. this workshop is designed to hone students’ spanish speaking skills. students will engage with formal and informal registers through different language samples, including those from social media outlets, academic texts, and different forms of cultural expressions—namely, poetry, fiction, culinary arts, and film. the past decade has seen crowds take to the streets time and again to confront unjust policies and infractions in the rule of law. while such protests have a relatively long history, stretching back at least as far as the 18th century, what has been new is the proliferation of alternative forms of protest, rooted largely in the the visual and performing arts. this course examines ways in which artists have increasingly made their voices heard in the political arena, using image and text to express dissent and move others to action. we examine case studies from around the world, including countries as far-flung as russia, china, mexico, and the u.s. we also consider the ways artists have challenged their publics to think more deeply about some of the fundamental issues related to gender, class, race, and the current world order. the course combines a historical and theoretical perspective with hands-on assignments and activities that ask students to engage themselves in cultural and political critique. no prior experience in art-making necessary. with readings, documentary films, discussions, and lectures, this course will examine the complex spiritual beliefs and expressions of peoples of african descent in brazil, cuba, haiti, jamaica, and north america. the course surveys african diasporic religions such as candomble, santeria, voodoo, shango, and african american religions. attention will be paid to how diasporic africans practice religion for self-definition, community building, and sociocultural critique, and for reshaping the religious and cultural landscapes of the americas. achilles' heel, the trojan horse, pandora's box, an oedipal complex, and a herculean task. these themes and figures from classical mythology continue to play an important role in our everyday life. we will read the original tales of classical heroes and heroines as depicted by homer, the greek tragedians, vergil, ovid, and others. why do these stories continue to engage, entertain, and even shock us? what is the nature and power of myth? readings from ancient sources in english translation. this course offers an introduction to some of the major subfields of psychology, such as developmental, personality, abnormal, clinical, physiological, cognitive, cultural, and social psychology. students will explore various theoretical perspectives and research methods used by psychologists to study the origins and variations in human behavior. thinking sociologically enables us to understand the intersection of our individual lives with larger social issues and to grasp how the social world works. students in this course will become familiar with the background of sociology and the core analytical concepts employed by sociologists. students will also gain familiarity with the major substantive topics explored by sociology, with focused attention given to the study of social structures, material, cultural, and institutional explanations of social action, and using concepts for real-world problem-solving.
 come explore the cosmos at the historic whitin observatory! this course will cover various exciting topics about space and include some hands-on experience with telescopes. this course provides an overview of the universe through the lens of the physical principles that help us to probe it from right here on our puny planetary perch. topics include stars and their planetary companions, the lives and deaths of stars, black holes, galaxies, and the origin and fate of the universe. hands-on activities will cover both naked-eye astronomy (e.g. the motions of the sun and stars) and techniques of modern astronomy (e.g. digital imagery). (please note that classes will meet in the evenings in order to view the night sky.) this course offers an interdisciplinary introduction to environmental studies, with a focus on a climate change. major concepts that will be examined include: the state of scientific research, the role of science, politics, and economics in environmental decisionmaking, and the importance of history, ethics and justice in approaching environmental issues. the central aim of the course is to help students develop the interdisciplinary research skills necessary to pose questions, investigate problems, and develop strategies that will help us address our relationship to the environment. this course explores the powerful roles that technology plays in contemporary social life and suggests that some of the impacts that our ever-greater reliance on, and faith in, technology might have upon our lives. the course begins with a critical overview of the heralded promises that technology often carries; here, we explore some of the undersides of so-called ""technological progress."" the remainder of the course examines a variety of salient contemporary issues concerning the social implications of technological change. what allows us to send text messages that are unreadable to anyone other than the intended recipient? what makes an internet credit card transaction safe? this workshop will be an overview of the mathematics behind cryptography, the art and science of coding and decoding secret messages. we will follow a historical path, starting with simple encryption techniques used in sparta, followed by a study of some more sophisticated substitution ciphers of the 18th and 19th century and a close look at the enigma machine used by the germans in world war ii. we will at the end examine two modern public key ciphers, diffie-hellman and rsa, whose advent in the 1970s revolutionalized the way we communicate even today in our daily digital interactions. in 1905, albert einstein published three seminal papers in the history of modern science, introducing the theory of special relativity, launching the field of quantum mechanics, and helping establish the atomic nature of matter. we will use einstein's contributions as a springboard for an introductory exploration of the natures of light, matter, space, and time. we will make use of algebra and geometry -- no calculus required. come explore the cosmos at the historic whitin observatory! this course will cover various exciting topics about space and include some hands-on experience with telescopes. this course provides an overview of the universe through the lens of the physical principles that help us to probe it from right here on our puny planetary perch. topics include stars and their planetary companions, the lives and deaths of stars, black holes, galaxies, and the origin and fate of the universe. hands-on activities will cover both naked-eye astronomy (e.g. the motions of the sun and stars) and techniques of modern astronomy (e.g. digital imagery). (please note that classes will meet in the evenings in order to view the night sky.) in this hands-on workshop you'll learn how to use microcontrollers, which are found in smart phones, dishwashers, space ships, and more. we'll start off with simple projects to introduce the micro-controller and its programming environments, build circuits, and learn to use sensors. over the first few days, these projects will quickly gain complexity until you're ready to design and create a project of personal interest to you toward the end of the week. along the way you'll learn a bit about the engineering design process, programming, circuits, creativity, and teamwork. this workshop is intended to be a launchpad for further exploration: the microcontroller kit and final project that you create will be yours to bring home and continue working with at the end of the session. description: when information is sent from one point to another, there are many ways in which its content can be compromised. in certain cases, there could be a malicious human actor who wants to steal or alter your data. in other cases (such as when a remote spacecraft is relaying information from another planet), the biggest threat might be random noise and interference that can corrupt the message and render it undecipherable. in both of these cases, we rely heavily on algorithms and protocols that help protect our information. in this workshop we will explore some of the ways in which mathematical ideas give us the tools to defend our data. although we will draw from a variety of mathematical fields, all ideas will be accessible to anyone with a background in high school algebra. this course offers an interdisciplinary introduction to environmental studies, with a focus on a climate change. major concepts that will be examined include: the state of scientific research, the role of science, politics, and economics in environmental decisionmaking, and the importance of history, ethics and justice in approaching environmental issues. the central aim of the course is to help students develop the interdisciplinary research skills necessary to pose questions, investigate problems, and develop strategies that will help us address our relationship to the environment. in this workshop, we explore the technologies that enable web-based platforms and the way they have transformed how we communicate, learn, and experience society. we interweave technical and social aspects of the social web. on the technical side, we study three programming languages: html5, css, and basic javascript. on the social side, we will discuss a variety of cyberspace issues such as quality and reliability of online information, personal and group privacy, and networked creativity through crowdfunding. no prior knowledge of computing is assumed. sharks have inhabited the world’s oceans for over 400 million years. while their biology and evolutionary history is a story of triumph, the portrayal of sharks in various forms of media is largely negative, focusing on sharks as monsters and “man-eaters”, and often times is biologically inaccurate. these representations are one of several factors that have led to the decline of shark populations worldwide. this course will enable students to understand shark biology and evaluate the accuracy of the portrayal of sharks through various forms of writing, including an exploratory essay, an editorial, a popular press article, and a research paper. students will read and discuss popular and scientific articles on shark biology and literary excerpts to develop ideas for writing assignments, share their writing through peer review, and respond to constructive criticism to develop their writing skills and gain a better understanding of this impressive group of animals. an introduction to the fundamental ideas and methods of statistics for analyzing data. topics include descriptive statistics, basic probability, inference, and hypothesis testing. emphasis on understanding the use and misuse of statistics in a variety of fields, including medicine and both the physical and social sciences. this course is intended to be accessible to those students who have not yet had calculus.

6105,"arts & design, law & government, leadership, social sciences, stem"," this workshop will introduce students to young children’s literature and its importance to the development of language and pre-literacy skills. we will explore classic children’s books, the importance to young children of seeing themselves in the books they read, and contemporary examples of children’s books that provide positive images and stories for all children. students will discuss assigned readings in the morning half of the workshop, and analyze selected children’s books. in the afternoon, students will have hands-on relevant experiences to put their morning work to use including visiting a local bookshop, the town library and an early childhood program. students will also present group projects. assigned readings will be required for class discussion. this workshop starts with the premise that food is an essential ingredient in the making of selves, families, communities, regions, and nations. we will explore the ways that we celebrate food traditions, create new habits and tastes, and also respond to food problems (e.g. food scarcity and safety, climate change and land use, and the complex networks of food producers, servers, and consumers). our readings will draw from a variety of different fields and perspectives, including literature, history, anthropology, and environmental studies, as well as various genres of food writing - the personal essay, the recipe, and scholarly essays on the intersections between food and culture. our course materials will provide an introduction into the emergent and growing interdisciplinary field of “food studies” and will help us see food as inextricably connected to our economic, political, and social structures. this intensive weeklong workshop will provide students with an introduction to the fundamentals of photography. technical skills such as camera use, composition, lighting, developing, and printing will be learned through demonstrations and assignments. conceptual, aesthetic, and critical skills essential to understanding photography's broader role in contemporary art and society will be learned through, readings, discussions, lectures, and critiques.  in this workshop, students will explore the hidden depths of what is around us, learning to ask and answer the kinds of questions that inspire scholars. in the first week, our focus will be on names, as we examine the stories behind the labels that we affix to people, places, and things. these explorations will be driven by questions that are at once philosophical and practical: how do new products get their names, and how do those names influence consumers? who decides what new names for things end up in the dictionary? what happens when a country changes its name? in the second week, we’ll shift gears to examine the physical world around us, using wellesley’s campus as our laboratory. the college’s unique landscape and architecture will provide an exciting source of study, as we probe the meaning behind the hogwarts-style buildings and trace the experiences of students who have come before us. throughout the course, we’ll take both an analytical and a creative approach to our topic, and students will have the chance to produce written arguments, imagine and pitch new products, and try their hand at making metaphors, maps, and multi-media scholarly projects. this intensive studio course is designed to help intensify your visual sensitivity, spatial awareness and creative response through the mediums of drawing and printmaking. in the first half of the course, we will focus on observational drawing—you will learn to translate what you see in the three-dimensional space around you to the two-dimensional surface of paper. in the second week, you will apply these observational skills to relief and monotype printmaking processes, and get to see your images reversed, multiplied and in color! by developing a sensitivity for materials, an understanding of key visual elements, and an ability to discuss visual concepts, you will build a strong foundation for yourself in the arts. by expanding the scope of your design ideas, this program will enhance your abstract thinking, problem-solving and visual communication skills while helping you develop necessary tools to exhibit and present your work. as the scenic, lighting, and costume designer, you will learn to read and analyze a script, sketch, draft and build scale models, create a light plot, swatch and render costume designs. taught by experienced faculty and professional designers who share their own processes and provide experience in all aspects of design/technology, this program will expand your portfolio and your understanding of what you will be doing in college and beyond. writing very short fiction and creative non-fiction like travel writing offers students an intensive opportunity to work as real writers work: real writers write, show their work to friendly readers, and revise. this course is for young women who already write fiction and/or creative non-fiction and for those who have never written a story or a travel essay, but are ready to take a chance. in this class, you will be a world builder. how can you create/imagine new possibilities for ourselves and others through your writing? what kinds of futures have you been made aware of through recent science fiction/fantasy films, and how can you use your analyses of the films to affect the way people see the world? by studying recent fantasy films, you will find inspiration for your own constructions of the future. while practicing the basics of expository writing (developing ideas, polishing our prose, making clear arguments, and organizing paragraphs), you will read other writers’ published work about how to make our world better. but it will be your words that push the boundaries of what others believe is possible. join me in suspending disbelief and believing in your power to change the world.
 for the purpose of electing representatives to the united states congress, each state is divided into a number of congressional districts. this number depends on the population, as measured by the most recent census. but what is the most fair way to draw the boundaries of these districts? the topic of gerrymandering (constructing district boundaries in order to give one party an advantage over another) has been the subject of recent litigation in a number of states. this workshop will provide an overview of some of the mathematical ideas that can be brought to bear on this important problem. no advanced mathematical knowledge will be assumed. how can a candidate in a political race win the majority of votes yet lose the election? how can constituents from underrepresented communities comprise almost half the electorate in a district yet have no representation in the legislature? how does the shape of a voting district affect who its inhabitants elect? can we measure and quantify the power of the president of the united states? how can two competing candidates interpret the same statistic as being in their favor? what is cryptography and what does it have to do with privacy and law enforcement?
 there’s no better place to discover your voice, your strengths and who you are as a leader than at wellesley. in this workshop, we’ll begin by taking a look at successful women leaders and role models throughout history to better understand leadership and some of the barriers women have faced. then we will explore many different types of leadership behaviors such as relationship building, teamwork, empathy, resilience, self-expression, navigating conflict, communication styles, learning from mistakes and more. during the week, you will participate in a variety of self-assessments, and fun yet thoughtful activities designed to help identify interests and strengths. you will learn a lot about yourself and your impact on those around you. you’ll leave with a visual representation of your pathway and some great insights about yourself as a present and future leader. what does your personal brand, or how you present yourself in the world, say about you? it's time to take a look and discover your voice, your strengths and who you are as a leader. our journey will start by taking a look back at successful women leaders and discussing how their strengths and values helped them be successful. we'll look at leadership in general and some of the barriers women have faced. then we will explore many different types of leadership behaviors such as relationship building, teamwork, empathy, resilience, self-expression, navigating conflict, communication styles, learning from mistakes and more. at the same time, you'll learn critical skills to help you present your unique strengths and show the world who you are. gain social confidence and competence with foundational skills that will not only carry you through life, but also provide you with a competitive advantage as you kick start your grown-up life.this hands-on workshop includes interactive activities and role-playing to help you polish your presence and build basics in financial literacy. topics will cover a broad range of topics, including college & career interviewing skills, email writing, social media netiquette, table manners, budgeting basics, hand-shakes and introductions.you will participate in a variety of self-assessments, and fun yet thoughtful activities designed to help identify interests and strengths. you will learn a lot about yourself and your impact on those around you. this course will help students develop an understanding of women’s leadership and ways of influencing organizations.  topics will examine the personal, social, and structural dynamics that affect women as leaders, particularly in terms of how they are viewed, how their contributions are evaluated, and what kinds of opportunities are available to them. students will begin to uncover and understand the unique challenges, constraints, and opportunities that face women today as they ascend to leadership positions. key themes include the dynamics of power, authority, and influence, being different, managing multiple roles, and social expectations as they pertain to women.

6106,"arts & design, law & government, leadership, social sciences, stem"," this workshop will introduce students to young children’s literature and its importance to the development of language and pre-literacy skills. we will explore classic children’s books, the importance to young children of seeing themselves in the books they read, and contemporary examples of children’s books that provide positive images and stories for all children. students will discuss assigned readings in the morning half of the workshop, and analyze selected children’s books. in the afternoon, students will have hands-on relevant experiences to put their morning work to use including visiting a local bookshop, the town library and an early childhood program. students will also present group projects. assigned readings will be required for class discussion. this workshop starts with the premise that food is an essential ingredient in the making of selves, families, communities, regions, and nations. we will explore the ways that we celebrate food traditions, create new habits and tastes, and also respond to food problems (e.g. food scarcity and safety, climate change and land use, and the complex networks of food producers, servers, and consumers). our readings will draw from a variety of different fields and perspectives, including literature, history, anthropology, and environmental studies, as well as various genres of food writing - the personal essay, the recipe, and scholarly essays on the intersections between food and culture. our course materials will provide an introduction into the emergent and growing interdisciplinary field of “food studies” and will help us see food as inextricably connected to our economic, political, and social structures. this intensive weeklong workshop will provide students with an introduction to the fundamentals of photography. technical skills such as camera use, composition, lighting, developing, and printing will be learned through demonstrations and assignments. conceptual, aesthetic, and critical skills essential to understanding photography's broader role in contemporary art and society will be learned through, readings, discussions, lectures, and critiques.  in this workshop, students will explore the hidden depths of what is around us, learning to ask and answer the kinds of questions that inspire scholars. in the first week, our focus will be on names, as we examine the stories behind the labels that we affix to people, places, and things. these explorations will be driven by questions that are at once philosophical and practical: how do new products get their names, and how do those names influence consumers? who decides what new names for things end up in the dictionary? what happens when a country changes its name? in the second week, we’ll shift gears to examine the physical world around us, using wellesley’s campus as our laboratory. the college’s unique landscape and architecture will provide an exciting source of study, as we probe the meaning behind the hogwarts-style buildings and trace the experiences of students who have come before us. throughout the course, we’ll take both an analytical and a creative approach to our topic, and students will have the chance to produce written arguments, imagine and pitch new products, and try their hand at making metaphors, maps, and multi-media scholarly projects. this intensive studio course is designed to help intensify your visual sensitivity, spatial awareness and creative response through the mediums of drawing and printmaking. in the first half of the course, we will focus on observational drawing—you will learn to translate what you see in the three-dimensional space around you to the two-dimensional surface of paper. in the second week, you will apply these observational skills to relief and monotype printmaking processes, and get to see your images reversed, multiplied and in color! by developing a sensitivity for materials, an understanding of key visual elements, and an ability to discuss visual concepts, you will build a strong foundation for yourself in the arts. by expanding the scope of your design ideas, this program will enhance your abstract thinking, problem-solving and visual communication skills while helping you develop necessary tools to exhibit and present your work. as the scenic, lighting, and costume designer, you will learn to read and analyze a script, sketch, draft and build scale models, create a light plot, swatch and render costume designs. taught by experienced faculty and professional designers who share their own processes and provide experience in all aspects of design/technology, this program will expand your portfolio and your understanding of what you will be doing in college and beyond. writing very short fiction and creative non-fiction like travel writing offers students an intensive opportunity to work as real writers work: real writers write, show their work to friendly readers, and revise. this course is for young women who already write fiction and/or creative non-fiction and for those who have never written a story or a travel essay, but are ready to take a chance. in this class, you will be a world builder. how can you create/imagine new possibilities for ourselves and others through your writing? what kinds of futures have you been made aware of through recent science fiction/fantasy films, and how can you use your analyses of the films to affect the way people see the world? by studying recent fantasy films, you will find inspiration for your own constructions of the future. while practicing the basics of expository writing (developing ideas, polishing our prose, making clear arguments, and organizing paragraphs), you will read other writers’ published work about how to make our world better. but it will be your words that push the boundaries of what others believe is possible. join me in suspending disbelief and believing in your power to change the world.
 for the purpose of electing representatives to the united states congress, each state is divided into a number of congressional districts. this number depends on the population, as measured by the most recent census. but what is the most fair way to draw the boundaries of these districts? the topic of gerrymandering (constructing district boundaries in order to give one party an advantage over another) has been the subject of recent litigation in a number of states. this workshop will provide an overview of some of the mathematical ideas that can be brought to bear on this important problem. no advanced mathematical knowledge will be assumed. how can a candidate in a political race win the majority of votes yet lose the election? how can constituents from underrepresented communities comprise almost half the electorate in a district yet have no representation in the legislature? how does the shape of a voting district affect who its inhabitants elect? can we measure and quantify the power of the president of the united states? how can two competing candidates interpret the same statistic as being in their favor? what is cryptography and what does it have to do with privacy and law enforcement?
 there’s no better place to discover your voice, your strengths and who you are as a leader than at wellesley. in this workshop, we’ll begin by taking a look at successful women leaders and role models throughout history to better understand leadership and some of the barriers women have faced. then we will explore many different types of leadership behaviors such as relationship building, teamwork, empathy, resilience, self-expression, navigating conflict, communication styles, learning from mistakes and more. during the week, you will participate in a variety of self-assessments, and fun yet thoughtful activities designed to help identify interests and strengths. you will learn a lot about yourself and your impact on those around you. you’ll leave with a visual representation of your pathway and some great insights about yourself as a present and future leader. what does your personal brand, or how you present yourself in the world, say about you? it's time to take a look and discover your voice, your strengths and who you are as a leader. our journey will start by taking a look back at successful women leaders and discussing how their strengths and values helped them be successful. we'll look at leadership in general and some of the barriers women have faced. then we will explore many different types of leadership behaviors such as relationship building, teamwork, empathy, resilience, self-expression, navigating conflict, communication styles, learning from mistakes and more. at the same time, you'll learn critical skills to help you present your unique strengths and show the world who you are. gain social confidence and competence with foundational skills that will not only carry you through life, but also provide you with a competitive advantage as you kick start your grown-up life.this hands-on workshop includes interactive activities and role-playing to help you polish your presence and build basics in financial literacy. topics will cover a broad range of topics, including college & career interviewing skills, email writing, social media netiquette, table manners, budgeting basics, hand-shakes and introductions.you will participate in a variety of self-assessments, and fun yet thoughtful activities designed to help identify interests and strengths. you will learn a lot about yourself and your impact on those around you. this course will help students develop an understanding of women’s leadership and ways of influencing organizations.  topics will examine the personal, social, and structural dynamics that affect women as leaders, particularly in terms of how they are viewed, how their contributions are evaluated, and what kinds of opportunities are available to them. students will begin to uncover and understand the unique challenges, constraints, and opportunities that face women today as they ascend to leadership positions. key themes include the dynamics of power, authority, and influence, being different, managing multiple roles, and social expectations as they pertain to women.
 we're constantly hearing about feminism these days. some think it's essential for modern life; others see it leading to the downfall of almost everything good. this course offers an introduction to feminism: what is it, what does it want, and how does it go about reaching its goals. we're going to focus on american feminism as it's developed by a variety of women: non-white and white, lgbtq+ and heterosexual, liberal and conservative, to name a few. this workshop will provide an introduction to the topic of abnormal psychology. specifically, we will first discuss how to diagnose mental illness, including ethical considerations, and then we will cover several different categories of mental disorder (e.g., neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and attention deficit disorder, depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia, etc.), with an emphasis on diagnosis and intervention (prevention and treatment). we will review case studies, video clips, and movies to highlight the way that different forms of mental illness are expressed. from the women’s marches to the #metoo movement, we are living in a moment of feminist uprising. yet for many young women, “feminism” is a bad word—a label that connotes man-hating and extremism, or that reflects the narrow experience of privileged white women. this course invites a deeper understanding of what feminism means today, exploring a range of modern feminist narratives with a focus on women of color. our discussion will be guided by several critical questions: how do the many facets of women’s identities—particularly race, gender, class, and sexuality—shape their needs, desires, and priorities? how might these differences be a source of collective power rather than division? in sum, what are the challenges and possibilities of building a truly inclusive feminist movement? students will have the unique opportunity to explore feminist arts and activism on the wellesley college campus, with field trips to the davis museum and college archives. in grappling with the “f-word,” students will hone their skills in analytical writing, while exploring their own relationship with feminism in a capstone personal essay. we all have friends and we tend to regard friendship as an important good. this seminar undertakes a philosophical examination of the nature and value of friendship. two main questions will animate the course: what is a friend? and, why are friends valuable? we will examine different types of friendships and the features that characterize and sustain them. many philosophers have argued that the best kind of friendship is one in which the friend is loved for her own sake; we will investigate whether this is truly possible or whether all friendships are ultimately instrumental. we'll also examine how the partiality inherent in friendship conflicts with the demands of standard moral theories. finally, drawing on examples from literature and film, we will consider whether one has to be a good person in order to be a good friend. in 2007, for the first time in history, more people lived in cities than rural communities. by 2050, the un predicts that over two-thirds of people will live in cities. we face an increasingly urban future, and an uncertain one. this class invites us to pause and reflect on the basics of cities and the urban experience. we will start with the individual experience of city life, then explore neighborhood structure, before scaling up to consider globalization and world cities. throughout we will explore key challenges of urban life: segregation, social inequality, poverty, gentrification, and the changing basis of community and belonging. to understand the city, we will start our discussions in the classroom, bringing in documentaries and short readings, and then embark on two field trips to nearby boston to see concepts in action and to hone our skills as social observers. students will learn to see the city in more detail, and write analytically and persuasively from their own observations. bring your walking shoes and your imagination – this is a course where you will learn on your feet. this workshop is designed to hone students’ spanish speaking skills. students will engage with formal and informal registers through different language samples, including those from social media outlets, academic texts, and different forms of cultural expressions—namely, poetry, fiction, culinary arts, and film. the past decade has seen crowds take to the streets time and again to confront unjust policies and infractions in the rule of law. while such protests have a relatively long history, stretching back at least as far as the 18th century, what has been new is the proliferation of alternative forms of protest, rooted largely in the the visual and performing arts. this course examines ways in which artists have increasingly made their voices heard in the political arena, using image and text to express dissent and move others to action. we examine case studies from around the world, including countries as far-flung as russia, china, mexico, and the u.s. we also consider the ways artists have challenged their publics to think more deeply about some of the fundamental issues related to gender, class, race, and the current world order. the course combines a historical and theoretical perspective with hands-on assignments and activities that ask students to engage themselves in cultural and political critique. no prior experience in art-making necessary. with readings, documentary films, discussions, and lectures, this course will examine the complex spiritual beliefs and expressions of peoples of african descent in brazil, cuba, haiti, jamaica, and north america. the course surveys african diasporic religions such as candomble, santeria, voodoo, shango, and african american religions. attention will be paid to how diasporic africans practice religion for self-definition, community building, and sociocultural critique, and for reshaping the religious and cultural landscapes of the americas. achilles' heel, the trojan horse, pandora's box, an oedipal complex, and a herculean task. these themes and figures from classical mythology continue to play an important role in our everyday life. we will read the original tales of classical heroes and heroines as depicted by homer, the greek tragedians, vergil, ovid, and others. why do these stories continue to engage, entertain, and even shock us? what is the nature and power of myth? readings from ancient sources in english translation. this course offers an introduction to some of the major subfields of psychology, such as developmental, personality, abnormal, clinical, physiological, cognitive, cultural, and social psychology. students will explore various theoretical perspectives and research methods used by psychologists to study the origins and variations in human behavior. thinking sociologically enables us to understand the intersection of our individual lives with larger social issues and to grasp how the social world works. students in this course will become familiar with the background of sociology and the core analytical concepts employed by sociologists. students will also gain familiarity with the major substantive topics explored by sociology, with focused attention given to the study of social structures, material, cultural, and institutional explanations of social action, and using concepts for real-world problem-solving.
